This repository hosts a web server developed in Rust, leveraging the Actix-web framework for high performance and concurrency. Designed to provide RESTful APIs, it enables the frontend to visualize processed data effectively. The server features several endpoints: one for fetching processed datasets, another for querying specific data points based on parameters, and a third for facilitating real-time data updates, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface. Emphasis is placed on security and efficient concurrency handling, making the server robust and capable of supporting scalable applications.
